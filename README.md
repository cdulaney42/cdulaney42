- 👋 Hi, I’m @cdulaney42 and I'm pretty new to this whole game.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a coder and looking to improve every day. 1 day at a time!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning prep work through App Academy.  I'm doing the prep and also working on my pre-course assessments.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything that I am currently studying.  This will be changing week to week or day to day.
